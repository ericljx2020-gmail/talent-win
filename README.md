## Email Setup

The contact form uses EmailJS to send emails without a backend server.

**To enable email functionality:**
1. Follow the instructions in `EMAILJS_SETUP.md`
2. Sign up at [EmailJS.com](https://www.emailjs.com/) (free tier: 200 emails/month)
3. Configure your credentials in `src/components/Contact.jsx`

The form will work without setup (demo mode), but emails won't actually be sent until you configure EmailJS.

## Customization

- Update company information in the Contact component
- Modify services in the Services component
- Change color scheme in CSS files
- Add your logo by replacing the emoji icon in Header
- Replace placeholder images with your own professional photos

## Technologies Used

- React 18
- Vite
- CSS3 (with modern features like Grid, Flexbox, animations)
